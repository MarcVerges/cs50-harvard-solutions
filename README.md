# Cs50-harvard-solutions

**My personal solutions to the CS50x Harvard programming course, written entirely by me using CS50-provided libraries.**

---

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from Harvard University's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science.  
All code was written by me as part of my learning process, and follows the guidelines and constraints of the original course.  
The programs are implemented in C and make use of the `cs50.h` library provided by the course for handling input and memory operations.  
Each solution reflects my own approach to problem-solving and has been completed without copying any external submissions.  
The repository is organized by week and topic, and includes inline comments to aid readability and explain logic where appropriate.  
This work is intended for educational purposes only and to document my progress in one of the most well-known computer science introductions.
